# Transaction Manager Setup: Next Steps

## Current Status

We've created several improved setup scripts to handle the database initialization and SQLx configuration:

1. `setup_app.sh` - Primary script that attempts both local PostgreSQL and Docker-based setup
2. `setup_local_database.sh` - Improved script for local PostgreSQL setup (fixed the `--merged` flag issue)
3. `setup_database.sh` - Fixed Docker-based setup script (removed the `--merged` flag) 
4. `setup_sqlx_offline.sh` - Minimal setup for SQLx offline mode without a database connection

## Database Setup

âœ… The database setup part is now working correctly:
- Local PostgreSQL connection is working
- Database schema has been created
- SQLx metadata has been generated

## Current Issues

1. **Rust Toolchain Proxy Issue**
   
   You're seeing:
   ```
   error: unknown proxy name: 'cursor'; valid proxy names are 'rustc', 'rustdoc', 'cargo', 'rust-lldb', 'rust-gdb', 'rust-gdbgui', 'rls', 'cargo-clippy', 'clippy-driver', 'cargo-miri', 'rust-analyzer', 'rustfmt', 'cargo-fmt'
   ```
   
   This indicates an issue with your Rust installation or IDE configuration, specifically related to Cursor IDE. This error is unrelated to the database or SQLx setup.

2. **Docker Permission Issue**
   
   Docker is installed but you don't have permission to use it without sudo. This isn't critical since the local PostgreSQL setup works, but if you want to use the Docker setup, you would need to:
   
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   # Then log out and log back in
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Rust Toolchain Issue**:
   
   Try the following:
   
   ```bash
   # Run directly with absolute paths to bypass the proxy
   /home/harshmahajan/.cargo/bin/cargo build
   
   # Or reset your Rust toolchain settings
   rustup default stable
   ```

   If that doesn't work, you may need to check your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or other shell config files for any custom Rust-related settings.

2. **Run the Application**:
   
   Once the Rust toolchain issue is fixed, you should be able to run the application with:
   
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   The SQLx offline mode is correctly configured, so the application should build without needing a database connection.

3. **Test the Application**:
   
   After successfully starting the application, you can test it with:
   
   ```bash
   # Test the health endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8080/
   
   # Register a user
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"securepassword","first_name":"Test","last_name":"User"}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/register
   ```

4. **Performance Testing** (After application is running):
   
   Run the performance tests with:
   
   ```bash
   ./run_performance_tests.sh
   ```

   Or track performance improvements over time:
   
   ```bash
   ./track_performance.sh
   ```

If you continue to have issues with the Rust toolchain, consider re-installing Rust with:

```bash
rustup self uninstall
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then run the setup script again:

```bash
./setup_app.sh
```
